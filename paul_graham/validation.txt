what bites them the second time is a confluence of three forces :
and to the extent you can , try to avoid the worst pitfalls of consulting
that sort of thing you can learn when you need to , and forget after you ` ve done it
`` and the partner replying `` just
it never gets any easier
among other things it gives you more options to choose your life 's work from
in fact , so unconsciously that you do n't even realize at first that they 're startup ideas
when you start fundraising , everything else grinds to a halt
the best type of intro is from a well-known investor who has just invested in you
you ca n't let how much you want an investor influence your estimate of how much they want you
and it ` s also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses to gratify it
have multiple plans
be profitable if you can
occasionally you ` ll encounter investors who describe themselves as `` valuation sensitive
a greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it right now
do n't reject an acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future
but if it does , `` get the best investors `` is in the average case bad advice
( the situation is different in phase 1
there does n't seem any particular urgency to be profitable
the other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses grow too fast
if anything oversensitive
inexperienced founders make the same mistake when trying to convince investors
`` ( whereas when they do n't like you , they 'll be saying `` but what about x ?
and by convince yourself , i do n't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence
if it is n't , do n't try to raise money
and if you can do that you ` ll end up with more than added confidence
plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months in
[ 9 ] certainly some rejected google
if you know you ` re on the right track , then you also know why investors were wrong to reject you
the most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually
over-engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling
6 of that 11
i think more
right now , vcs often knowingly invest too much money at the series a stage
but i am daily waiting for the line to collapse
but galleries did n't want to be online
for example , a social network for pet owners
`` even when the startup launches , it will sound plausible to a lot of people
you do n't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that ` s changing fast
you could n't get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything
`` backrub seemed like an inconsequential science project
competition

the question then is whether that beachhead is big enough
we overcame this one to work on viaweb
when searching for ideas , look in areas where you have some expertise
that may seem like taking things to extremes , but startups are extreme
live in the future and build what seems interesting
out of 84 companies , 7 were making hardware
and it would n't be the first time investors learned that lesson from founders
the best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue
they could end up on a local maximum
weeklyyearly

it ` s the same with other high-beta vocations , like being an actor or a novelist
why do founders want to take the vcs ' money ?
growing slower might be slightly dangerous , but chances are it would n't kill them
the first rule i knew intellectually , but did n't really grasp till it happened to us
their chances of succeeding seem small
one could have described microsoft and apple in exactly the same terms
when you pick a big winner , you wo n't know it for two years
[ 5 ] but the percentage is certainly way over 30 %
everyone would agree that yc had jumped the shark
there was another speaker who was much better than me
it ` s probably what it was originally for
and for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me
email is not a messaging protocol
this is one of those ideas that ` s like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object
on one hand , entrenched protocols are impossible to replace
to make a startup hub , you need a lot of people interested in startups
